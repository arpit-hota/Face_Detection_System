# Face_Detection_System
Developed a light weight face detection system using  python, urllib, cv2, numpy, keras, pickel, os and other modules for developing the peroject. It is capable of identifying faces from human and from video in real-time. It can be used for security purpose, attandance system and can be modified for applications like traffic delection system,etc.
